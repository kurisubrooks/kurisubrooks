### Howdy

I'm a 23-year-old guy (he/him) from Sydney, Australia. I currently work at [Gehirn Inc.](https://www.gehirn.co.jp/en/), an I.T. Infrastructure, Security and Disaster Prevention company, as a Developer, Designer and Translator. I work to help save lives through disaster information distribution. We make [cool graphics](https://www.gehirn.co.jp/en/services/disaster/) that are used in digital signage, [have an app](https://nerv.app/) that warns people in real-time of impending disasters, and contribute to a small team of passionate developers who are working to keep people safe.

I've been a passionate web developer since I was a teen, writing CSS for Neopets homepages and making Habbo Hotel fansites for friends. Totalling over 10 years of experience, I'm very used to CSS' bullshit and can handle whatever it tries to throw at me. I started learning JavaScript a few years later after learning about Japan's "Earthquake Early Warning" system. I really wanted to use this information to write a program, so I could get notified of Japanese earthquakes in real-time, a quest that would lead to my current position at [Gehirn](https://www.gehirn.co.jp/en/).
